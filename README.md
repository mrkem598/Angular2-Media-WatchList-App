    This media watchlist app is a  web application that will allow me 
    to add media lists to the registry focus it down to just
    movies or series, and delete media items from their list.

    The app will have a single screen experience, and will swap out views for
    lists, and the media item forum. It will be a client side app, with no 
    server requests after the first load.
